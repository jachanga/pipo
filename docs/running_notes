## Doing
- Converting sendFileModal into a prototype and passing chatManager to it on init
- Changing the way that modals init so that they can have managers passed in on init
- Making sure that we wait for document ready in chatmanager init, then init all modals and move forward

## Questions/To Fix
- in ChatManager, focus chat, do we really need to be creating a new fileManager instance each time we click the downloadLink?
- Can we use nodecrypto everywhere, or require crypto??
- Need to have the server check to see if the files directory exists and if not, create it
- Is the files directory configurable easily from the config?
