# PiPo - A secure chat client with client side encryption written in NodeJS

## Goal
PiPo's goal is to make secure communication easy to use and open source. It is a client server appilcation that aims to remove the server from being a vulnerable point in the communication chain.

## Features

+ Client side encryption using AES-256 keys
+ Your private key never leaves your device
+ Key backup and restore
+ Markdown using the Marked Library and React (https://github.com/chjj/marked, https://facebook.github.io/react/)
+ Avatars from Gravatar

## Encryption

Currently PiPo uses the KbPGP library to do PGP encryption. Behind this is AES-256 with 4096 bit keys.

## Data Flow

### Uploading Files

The following is the the process in which a file traverses when being sent from the client to the server and then is retrieved.

+ File is selected by the modal and passed to the JS
At this point, files is an array of `File` objects. These file objects are a specific kind of `Blob`.
`var files = document.getElementById('sendfile-file-input').files;`

+ The modal passes the files object to the fileManager.readFiles method
`fileManager.readFiles(files, function(err){...`

+ A binary socket (via BinaryJS) is opened to the server

+ We set the file chunk size in `chunkSize`
`var chunkSize = 1048576;`

+ We break the file up into chunks per the chunkSize
The resulting chunks are `Blob` objects.
```
// Upload a whole chunk which is ( currentChunk * chunkSize )
if (currentChunk < wholeChunks) {
  start = ( currentChunk * chunkSize );
  end = (( currentChunk  + 1 ) * chunkSize );
}

// If this is the last chunk, set final bytes
// to ( currentChunk * chunkSize ) + finalChunk
if (currentChunk === wholeChunks) {
  start = ( currentChunk * chunkSize );
  end = ( currentChunk * chunkSize ) + finalChunk;
}

var blob = file.slice(start,end);
```

+ We begin reading chunks and sending them until we've read them all
Here the `Blobs` are read as an ArrayBuffer and evt.target.result returned as an ArrayBuffer

* It appears that we should be using FileReader.readAsArrayBuffer() instead as the method has been removed from the FileAPI standard *
```
reader.readAsArrayBuffer(blob);
currentChunk++;

while (currentChunk <= wholeChunks) {
  ...
  reader.onloadend = (function(chunkNum) {
    return function(evt) {
      if (evt.target.readyState == FileReader.DONE) {
        self.sendFile({
          fileChunkArrayBuffer: evt.target.result,
          ...
        }, function...
```

+ For each chunk, we convert the ArrayBuffer (fileArrayBuffer) into a kbpgp.Buffer (fileBuffer)
```
// fileManager.js
window.encryptionManager.encryptFile({
  file: fileChunkArrayBuffer,
  ...

// encryptionManager.js
var fileArrayBuffer = data.file;
var fileBuffer = new kbpgp.Buffer(fileArrayBuffer);

+ Then we encrypt using the `fileBuffer` and return a kbpgp.buffer (raw binary data buffer) `resultBuffer`
```
window.kbpgp.box({
  msg: fileBuffer,
  encrypt_for: keys,
  sign_with: self.keyManager
}, function(err, resultString, resultBuffer) {
    callback(err, resultBuffer);
});
```

+ Now we send the encryptedChunkBuffer via binaryJS to the server
```
var binStream = binSocketClient.binSocket.send(encryptedChunkBuffer, {
  fileName: fileName,
  ...
});

binStream.end();
```
+ When the server (server.js) gets a binSocket connection, it pass it along to socketServer.onBinarySocketConnection(binSocket) (socketServer.js)

+ When the SocketServer (socketServer.js) gets a `stream`, it pushes each chunk (which is a Buffer) into an array (parts)

+ When we get the `end` event on the `fileStream`, we use Buffer.concat(parts) to put the pieces back together
This may be an issue as the file is then saved in memory. Also we need to make sure that it is reassembeled correctly here.

+ The `fileBuffer` and metadata is then sent to `FileManager.handleChunk(data);` which handles each chunk of the file
We're really only chunking the file right now to save us from having to hold the entire file in memory while encrypting

+ `FileManager.handleChunk(data)` directly sends this data to the `PFile` model (models/file.js) to add the chunk and save it to disk
```
PFile.addChunk(data, function(err, pfile) {
  ...
```

+ The `PFile` model does an `fs.writeFile` to write the file to disk with binary encoding
```
fs.writeFile("files/" + pfileChunkName, fileBuffer, { encoding: 'binary' }, function(err) {
  ...
```

## How it works...
When a user signs up with their username, email address and password, an AES-256 keypair is generated within their browser. The public part of that keypair is then uploaded to the server and associated with that username. From here, access is granted to private rooms by an admin. The addition of this user is signed in a transaction that can then be verified by all clients back to one of the original two administrators. This removes the possibliity of a malitious attacker injecting their public key onto a compromised server and tricking users into sending them messages thinking they are someone else.

## Requirements
+ MongoDB
+ Node.js

## Quick Setup (Dev/Test)
To try out PiPo, I've included a sample adminCertificate. You should not use these for production as you do not have the private keys associated with these admin certificates.

+ Install the node modules

        npm install

+ Copy adminData.sample to adminData
+ The app will now start up in Client Key mode
+ Make sure MongoDB is running locally
+ Start the app

        npm start


## Setup
+ Place two admins public keys in adminData in the format username.pub
  + Generate Two Keys (repeat this process for the second key)
    + `gpg --gen-key`
    + Choose RSA and RSA
    + keysize should be at least 2048
    + Choose an amount of time for the key to expire
    + Your real name should be your username for pipo
    + Enter your email address
    + Comment can be blank if you like
    + Use a secure passphrase to protect your key
  + Export your public and private key to a file
    + List your secret keys to find the userID of your key which is a combination of full name (your username that you entered) along with email and comment
      + `gpg --list-secret-keys`
    + `gpg --export -a "username <username@mydomain.com>" --output adminData/username.pub`
    + Place the two username.pub files in the adminData directory
  + Run setup again: `npm run setup`
  + Generate a clearsign signature from each secret key for the generated adminPayload
    + `gpg --clearsign -u "username <username@mydomain.com>" adminData/adminPayload --output adminData/username.sig`
  + Run seutp again: `npm run setup`
    + You should see the server start and tell you that out found the signatures
    + This will generate the adminCertificate
  + Run `npm start` to start the server (make sure Mongo is running)
  + Run `npm run start-client` to start the electron client

## Protocol Outline & Planning Considerations

### Authentication
+ Initial Signup
  + signature verification, user creates invite object with a random token created by the client
  + this token is sha256 hashed and sent to the server,
  + the client pgp encrpts the non-hashed token and sends it to the invitee
  + then only the invitee can decrypt the token and then can send it to the server,
  + which can do a sha256
+ authenticate and sign of request using pgp keys?
+ node_http_signature
  + Positives
  + Negatives
    + Whitepaper not quite complete yet
    + Have not addressed two factor
    + Does not include eliptical curve in their docs
    + * Does not have revocation for identity in case of compromise *
+ sqrl
  + Positives
    + Creates QR codes to scan with phnoe for authentication with sessions which is easy
    + Creates revocation
    + Allows you to print QR code for private key so it does not exist elictroncially
  + Negatives
    + Seems over engineered
    + Uniqe terms for all types of keys so it is cryptic cryptography


### Sessions
+ Use keyid to verify user and do not use sessions?
+ How do we indicate that the data is encrypted?


### Server Management of Keys
+ Server generates a shared private key
+ Server encrypts private key to all users that are granted access using their personal public key
+ Server destroys unencrypted shared private key
+ Server sends new encrypted private key to users as they sign on
  + Possible to have client with rights to add user create the private key and encrypt to all users then upload to server
